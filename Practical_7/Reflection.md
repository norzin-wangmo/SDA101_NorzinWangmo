# Reflection — Practical 7: JavaScript Interaction Exercises

## Objective
Implement small interactive features using vanilla JavaScript to practise DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic UI feedback.

## What I built
- A simple interactive exercise page (`Excercise_1/index.html`) wired to a JavaScript file (`In Script.js`) that handles user events and updates the DOM.
- Controls and elements include buttons, inputs and dynamic content updates to demonstrate event listeners and state changes.

## Key learnings
- Practised selecting DOM elements, adding/removing classes, and updating element text and attributes.
- Used event listeners for `click`, `input`, and `submit` to react to user interactions.
- Improved debugging skills using the browser DevTools console and breakpoints.

## Challenges
- Managing element state consistently across multiple event handlers required careful ordering and checks.
- File naming with spaces (`In Script.js`) can cause friction with tooling; renaming to a space-free filename is recommended.

## Improvements / Next steps
- Refactor JavaScript into smaller functions and add comments for readability.
- Rename the script file to `in-script.js` and update HTML references for better compatibility.
- Add more interactive examples (e.g., form validation, modal dialogs) and include screenshots in the README.

## Time spent
Approximately 2–3 hours on planning, implementation, testing, and debugging.

## Conclusion
This exercise strengthened practical skills in vanilla JavaScript and DOM interactions. Future iterations will refactor code for clarity and expand interactive examples for a richer learning portfolio.
