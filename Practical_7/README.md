# TailwindCSS Micro Interaction Exercise

## Instructions
Create a simple webpage with a micro interaction using TailwindCSS and ensure it is fully responsive.

### Steps

2. Style these elements using TailwindCSS classes to establish a basic layout.  
3. Choose a micro interaction effect (for example, a hover animation for a button that changes color or size).  
4. Utilize TailwindCSS responsive modifiers (such as `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to adjust styles based on screen size.  
5. Test the website on different devices and screen sizes to ensure it adapts properly.
