# Practical 7 – JavaScript Interaction Exercises

## Project overview
This folder contains Practical 7 for the SDA101 course: exercises focused on adding interactivity with JavaScript alongside semantic HTML and CSS. The work demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and small UI interactions.

---

## Folder structure (inside `Practical_7`)
Subfolder:
- `Excercise_1/`
  - `index.html` — Exercise 1 example page with interactive elements.
  - `In Script.js` — JavaScript file for Exercise 1 (contains event handlers and DOM manipulation). Note: file name includes a space as provided in the folder.

---

## How to view the exercises locally
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click the file) or use the Live Server extension in VS Code for live reload.
2. To run the Exercise 1 example, open `Excercise_1/index.html` in a browser. Ensure the `In Script.js` file is present in the same folder and properly linked in the HTML.
3. Interact with elements on the page (buttons, inputs, etc.) to see JavaScript-driven behaviors.

## Notes and tips
- If the JavaScript file name (`In Script.js`) contains a space it can still work in the browser, but it's recommended to use filenames without spaces (e.g., `in-script.js`) for portability and tooling compatibility.
- Use the browser DevTools Console to view errors or console.log output when debugging your scripts.
