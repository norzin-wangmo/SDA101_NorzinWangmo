# Replicating Website Design in Figma
This practical exercise involves using Figma to replicate the design of Collge website and a website of your choice(I chose RUB). The goal is to practice using Figma's tools and features to create a functional website layout and learning prototyping, drop-down menus, and other interactive elements.
