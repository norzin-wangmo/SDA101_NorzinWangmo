## 1. College Website Reflection

In this practical exercise, I learned how to effectively use Figma to replicate a website design. The process involved analyzing the original website's layout, colors, typography, and interactive elements. By recreating these components in Figma, I gained a deeper understanding of the design process and the importance of attention to detail.

One of the key challenges I faced was ensuring that the replicated design was not only visually similar but also functional. This required me to explore Figma's prototyping features, allowing me to create interactive elements such as buttons and drop-down menus. Through this experience, I learned how to create a seamless user experience by incorporating these interactive components.

Overall, this exercise has enhanced my skills in using Figma for web design and has provided me with valuable insights into the design process. I look forward to applying these skills in future projects.
