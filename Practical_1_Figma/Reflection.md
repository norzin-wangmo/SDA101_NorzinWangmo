## 1. College Website Reflection

In this practical exercise, I learned how to effectively use Figma to replicate a website design. The process involved analyzing the original website's layout, colors, typography, and interactive elements. By recreating these components in Figma, I gained a deeper understanding of the design process and the importance of attention to detail.

One of the key challenges I faced was ensuring that the replicated design was not only visually similar but also functional. This required me to explore Figma's prototyping features, allowing me to create interactive elements such as buttons and drop-down menus. Through this experience, I learned how to create a seamless user experience by incorporating these interactive components.

Overall, this exercise has enhanced my skills in using Figma for web design and has provided me with valuable insights into the design process. I look forward to applying these skills in future projects.

## 2. RUB Website Reflection

In this practical session, I learned how to use Figma to replicate the official Royal University of Bhutan (RUB) website. The task involved analyzing and recreating various web components, such as the navigation bar, hero image, programme listings, and footer section. By carefully observing the layout, color scheme, and typography, I was able to match the websiteâ€™s overall look and feel.

One of the most important parts of this exercise was maintaining visual consistency across pages, including interactive elements like the dropdown menu. It required precision in aligning text, adjusting spacing, and selecting the correct background colors to achieve a realistic replica.

Through this experience, I improved my understanding of UI design principles, layout structure, and how to prototype an entire webpage using Figma tools. It helped me develop a stronger eye for detail and boosted my confidence in designing professional and functional web layouts.
