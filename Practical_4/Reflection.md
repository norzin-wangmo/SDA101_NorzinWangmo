# Reflection – Practical 4: Lists and Tables Using HTML and CSS


## Main Concepts Applied
This practical focused on two major HTML structures: **Lists** and **Tables**.

1. **Lists:**  
   - Used ordered and unordered lists to organize information.  
   - Applied CSS counters and pseudo-elements (`::before`) to customize list numbering.  
   - Styled hover effects to make lists interactive and visually appealing.

2. **Tables:**  
   - Implemented tables using `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`.  
   - Added rows and columns to represent structured data (grades, prices, songs).  
   - Applied `border-collapse` for cleaner table design.

## New Skills or Knowledge Acquired
- Learned to use **CSS counters** for numbering custom lists.  
- Improved understanding of **semantic HTML** for lists and tables.  
- Discovered how to use **hover and focus states** for enhancing readability.  
- Understood the importance of **table structure and hierarchy** in HTML.

- Aligning data in different table columns neatly.  
- Ensuring numbering and hover colors remained uniform.

**Solutions:**
- Used padding and margin properties for alignment.  
- Verified list indentation and numbering with developer tools.  
- Defined consistent color palettes and box shadows in CSS.
