## Norwang Eats Wireframe 
In this practical exercise, I designed a low-fidelity wireframe for a food delivery website called Norwang Eats using Figma. The task helped me understand how to plan and visualize the structure of a website before moving into detailed design. I focused on creating multiple pages such as Home, Menu, Order Online, Payment, and Contact to represent a complete user journey.

One of the main challenges I faced was maintaining consistency in layout and spacing across all frames. To solve this, I used alignment tools and grids in Figma, which made the design more organized and visually balanced. I also explored linking pages through Figmaâ€™s prototyping feature to simulate realistic navigation between frames.

I learned the importance of user experience (UX) principles while designing the wireframe. I aimed to create intuitive navigation paths and clear call-to-action buttons to enhance usability. For example, I placed the "Order Now" button prominently on the Home and Menu pages to encourage user engagement.

Overall, this activity improved my understanding of wireframing and how it supports effective web design. It helped me learn how to design user-friendly page layouts, organize components clearly, and ensure smooth interaction flow throughout the website.
