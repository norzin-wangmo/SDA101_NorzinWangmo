# Wireframe Design in Figma – *Norwang Eats (Food Delivery App)*

This practical exercise involved creating a **low-fidelity wireframe** for a food delivery website named *Norwang Eats*.  
The goal was to understand the structure and flow of a multi-page website using Figma’s design tools.  
Through this, I learned how to organize navigation bars, forms, and buttons, and design a smooth order-to-payment process.
