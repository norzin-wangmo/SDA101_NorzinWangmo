# Reflection – Practical 6: Portfolio Webpage using HTML and CSS


## Main Concepts Applied
In this practical, I created a personal portfolio webpage using **HTML and CSS**.  
I applied several core layout and styling concepts, including:
- **Flexbox** for building a horizontal navigation bar and arranging skill cards.  
- **CSS Grid** for creating a responsive project gallery.  
- **Box shadow and hover effects** to enhance interactivity.  
- **Media queries** to make the layout responsive across devices.  

## New Skills or Knowledge Acquired
- Learned how to apply **Flexbox** and **Grid** layouts together effectively in a single project.  
- Improved my understanding of **responsive design** using media queries.  
- Gained experience in designing **reusable and structured CSS classes**.  
- Learned to separate concerns by linking an external `style.css` file for styling.

## What I Learned
This practical improved my ability to design and organize a webpage structure using semantic HTML elements.  
I learned to:
- Align items efficiently using Flexbox properties like `justify-content` and `align-items`.  
- Create adaptive grid systems with `grid-template-columns` and `auto-fit` for responsiveness.  
- Write cleaner and more modular CSS code by grouping similar styles.  

## Challenges and How I Overcame Them
**Challenges Faced:**  
- Difficulty in getting the navigation bar alignment correct across different screen sizes.  
- Balancing spacing and alignment in the Grid-based gallery.  
- Ensuring text readability over background gradients.

**Solutions:**  
- Used the browser developer tools to inspect and adjust layout alignment.  
- Applied media queries to handle mobile navigation layout changes.  
- Tweaked color contrast and padding for better readability.

## Clarity and Organization
This reflection is clearly organized under three sections as per the marking rubric: Documentation, Reflection, and Clarity.  
Each section presents ideas in a concise and well-structured manner.

## Conclusion
Through this practical, I strengthened my understanding of **CSS layout techniques** and **responsive design principles**.  
I am now more confident in using Flexbox and Grid to build structured, professional, and responsive webpages.

# Reflection – TailwindCSS Micro Interaction Exercise

## Overview
In this exercise, I created a **responsive webpage** using **TailwindCSS** with a purple theme.  
The main focus was to implement a **micro interaction** effect and ensure that the layout adapts smoothly across different screen sizes.

## What I Did
- Created an HTML structure with sections for **header**, **main content**, **practice exercises**, and **footer**.
- Styled the entire webpage using **TailwindCSS utility classes**.
- Added a **micro interaction** to the button — it scales up and glows slightly when hovered.
- Designed a **photo gallery** with a responsive grid that resizes neatly on different devices.
- Built a **job listing table** and a **college navigation bar** as part of the practice exercises.

## What I Learned
- How to use **TailwindCSS classes** for quick and efficient styling without writing custom CSS.
- How **responsive modifiers** like `sm:`, `md:`, and `lg:` automatically adjust the layout.
- How small **micro interactions** (like hover animations) can make a UI more engaging.
- The importance of testing on different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.

## Challenges Faced
- Remembering class names and balancing readability of long Tailwind class lists.
- Adjusting spacing and colors so that the purple theme looked elegant but not overwhelming.
- Ensuring the button animation stayed smooth on all devices.

## Improvements for Next Time
- Add **dark/light mode toggle** for accessibility.
- Implement **animations** for image hover transitions using Tailwind’s `animate` utilities.
- Include more content in the practice exercises, such as form designs or responsive cards.

## Conclusion
This exercise helped me understand how TailwindCSS simplifies modern web design.  
I gained hands-on experience with **utility-first styling**, **responsive design**, and **micro interactions**, all of which are essential for creating dynamic, modern web interfaces.
