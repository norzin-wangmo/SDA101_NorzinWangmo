# Reflection â€“ Practical 6: Portfolio Webpage using HTML and CSS


## Main Concepts Applied
In this practical, I created a personal portfolio webpage using **HTML and CSS**.  
I applied several core layout and styling concepts, including:
- **Flexbox** for building a horizontal navigation bar and arranging skill cards.  
- **CSS Grid** for creating a responsive project gallery.  
- **Box shadow and hover effects** to enhance interactivity.  
- **Media queries** to make the layout responsive across devices.  

## New Skills or Knowledge Acquired
- Learned how to apply **Flexbox** and **Grid** layouts together effectively in a single project.  
- Improved my understanding of **responsive design** using media queries.  
- Gained experience in designing **reusable and structured CSS classes**.  
- Learned to separate concerns by linking an external `style.css` file for styling.

## What I Learned
This practical improved my ability to design and organize a webpage structure using semantic HTML elements.  
I learned to:
- Align items efficiently using Flexbox properties like `justify-content` and `align-items`.  
- Create adaptive grid systems with `grid-template-columns` and `auto-fit` for responsiveness.  
- Write cleaner and more modular CSS code by grouping similar styles.  

## Challenges and How I Overcame Them
**Challenges Faced:**  
- Difficulty in getting the navigation bar alignment correct across different screen sizes.  
- Balancing spacing and alignment in the Grid-based gallery.  
- Ensuring text readability over background gradients.

**Solutions:**  
- Used the browser developer tools to inspect and adjust layout alignment.  
- Applied media queries to handle mobile navigation layout changes.  
- Tweaked color contrast and padding for better readability.

I am now more confident in using Flexbox and Grid to build structured, professional, and responsive webpages.
