3. Choose a micro interaction effect (for example, a hover animation for a button that changes color or size).  
4. Utilize TailwindCSS responsive modifiers (such as `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to adjust styles based on screen size.  
5. Test the website on different devices and screen sizes to ensure it adapts properly.
